The following libraries are built to simulate a quantum annealing protocol for the ferromagnetic Ising chain in a transverse field.
In library_annealing one can simulate the protcol, and estimate the quality of the state that has been produced;
while using linrary_measurments one can measure one and two point correlation functions along the three axis.
Before using it is good to run the the test via "pytest".
The following code was written based on the myQLM library and to run on the TGCC machines, some dependencies
may change for other usages.
